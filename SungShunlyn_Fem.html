                <h2>What is “Fembooks”?</h2>
                <p>
                    "Fembooks" is the first feminist bookstore in the Chinese-speaking <br>
                    area, with the mission of promoting gender equality. After years of <br>
                    hard work, it was classified as a Taiwanese women's cultural landmark <br>
                    in 2007 and has become a place of pilgrimage for foreign tourists and <br>
                    those who care about gender issues. In addition to selling books, the <br>
                    Women's Bookstore also cooperates with elementary and middle schools <br>
                    to promote the "Gender-Friendly Dandelion Project". By donating gender <br>
                    equality education books and holding lectures, it takes root from an <br>
                    early age and enhances children's care and attention to more gender <br>
                    issues.

                <h2>Gender Friendly Dandelion Project</h2>
                <p>
                    "Fembooks" leverages its expertise in book selection to promote the "Campus <br>
                    Good Books Love Reading Gender-Friendly Dandelion" project, and cooperates <br>
                    with sponsors from all walks of life to donate gender education, gender <br>
                    identity and other related books to educational institutions at all levels, <br>
                    ranging from elementary schools to junior colleges. institutions, aiming <br>
                    to promote awareness of gender equality on campus. Schools that receive <br>
                    donated books will set up a "women's book section" in the library to place <br>
                    donated books and create a gender-friendly corner. In addition to donating <br>
                    books, the women's bookstore will also hold lectures or reading clubs in <br>
                    each school, with themes based on the needs of the school, such as children's <br>
                    human rights awareness, sexual equality laws and other issues.

                <h2>Tenderness of "Fembooks" in the Me Too incident</h2>
                <p>
                    During the Me Too movement that swept across Taiwan a while ago, other <br>
                    independent bookstores were busy removing books from the shelves and <br>
                    distancing themselves from controversial figures, but the women's bookstore <br>
                    was involved in the storm of public opinion and made different choices. <br>
                    <br>
                    "We are not the arbiters." Song Shunlian, the chairman of the female bookstore, <br>
                    said firmly. "Every book is written by the author with his life. Is it equated <br>
                    with his personal life and morality?" In this noisy era, everyone has something <br>
                    to say, but who says the "right" thing? Until the decision is made, we are not <br>
                    the arbiters, and neither is the female bookstore. <br>
                    <br>
                    "We are a space, and this space is for everyone to have a dialogue. I think this <br>
                    is what women's bookstores have been doing."
