        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Founding philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            Song, Shunlyn understood the situation of women working in the technology <br>
            field who "cannot express themselves" after marriage, and further thought <br>
            about how women can balance work and family. <br>
            <br>
            In 1997, Song Shunlyn left her job at a law firm. Then she started to <br>
            assist in individual legal affairs and established her own studio. Later, <br>
            through introductions and recommendations from customers, the studio's <br>
            business volume grew steadily. Song Shunlyn gradually recruited a group <br>
            of women with scientific and technological backgrounds, allowing them to <br>
            use their talents and have a stable income to support these women in their <br>
            families and businesses. Achieving self-integration and self-management <br>
            in career, and practice a life of focusing on family and career.
